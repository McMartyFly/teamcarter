Drip is an email marketing automation platform that’s built to get you deeper insights and more revenue.

Part of its power comes from its JavaScript web tracking code, which lets you trigger automations and display popup forms based on who your site visitors are and which pages they’re viewing. The Drip plugin lets you unlock that power for your WordPress site.

It takes just one click to install the Drip plugin. Then, you’ll be ready to capture new subscribers and set up automations all across your website.

== SETTING UP DRIP ==

[First, you’ll want to set up a Drip account. (It’s free for your first 100 subscribers.)](https://www.drip.co/pricing)

Then, install the Drip plugin and select Drip from the Settings menu in your WordPress sidebar.

Then, enter your Drip Account ID, click Save Changes, and you’re done!
